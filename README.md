# EventSwipe

*Current version: Falcon*

EventSwipe is a Java application for recording attendance at events.

It can be used as a standalone desktop application or connected to the careers CRM system, [CareerHub](http://careerhub.info/).

It works by reading some kind of ID string (a student number, for example), indicating the booking status of that person and either updating CareerHub or recording their details locally to be processed later.

The ID can be entered from a keyboard or any other external input device, such as an RFID reader.

###Instructions

* [Download EventSwipe.jar and lib.zip](https://bitbucket.org/mattwildman/eventswipe/downloads)
* Extract the contents of lib.zip and save in the same folder as EventSwipe.jar
* Open EventSwipe.jar and got to file > settings and enter your installation specific settings

##Usage

###Preparing the booking lists

If the event didn't require students to book in advance then ignore this section.

EventSwipe can read ID strings from a .txt file separated by line breaks. Make sure your booking lists are saved in this format and accessible from the device running EventSwipe. 

You can upload up to three booking list files (for different timeslots within the same event) and a waiting list.

###Running the application

When you start up EventSwipe, you'll be asked to log in using your CareerHub details, or to start offline mode.

In online mode you will need to enter the CareerHub IDs of all your entry slots (or choose the slots by listing forthcoming events) and then select whether or not you want to load waiting lists.

In offline mode you will be asked to enter some details about the event. You need to enter a title and indicate whether or not you want to use a booking list and a waiting list. You can then upload all the necessary lists of IDs.

Hit ok to start recording attendance. Depending on the event settings and the attendee's booking status, when you enter an ID EventSwipe will display the following messages:

####'Success' messages

* __Booked__ - ID is on the booking list and entry has been recorded. EventSwipe will also display what entry slot the attendee has been booked for (if applicable)
* __Recorded__ - ID has been recorded (displayed when a booking list is not used) 

####Other messages

* __Already recorded__ - ID has already been entered and recorded
* __Not booked__ - ID is not on the booking list and is not recorded in the attendees list. EventSwipe will also open a dialogue box asking you whether or not to let the attendee into the event. Selecting 'Yes' records the student number.
* __Waiting list__ - ID is on the waiting list. EventSwipe will also open a dialogue box asking you whether or not to let the attendee into the event. Selecting 'Yes' records the student number and takes the student off the waiting list, 'No' keeps the student on the waiting list.
* __EVENT FULL__ - ID could not be booked onto the event because there are no more places (online mode only).

You can also record an ID which was not on the booking list by switching EventSwipe to 'record all mode' with the button in the top right. You can then enter a non-booked ID and record it. This mode is useful if you want to let in a batch of non-booked attendees in one go and can be used as a fall back to guarantee you record entry to your event, even if something goes wrong with your booking list.

###Saving the attendance list

####Offline mode

When you have finished recording entry to your event, hit 'finish', choose a file name and location and EventSwipe will save the list of recorded IDs (along with the entry slot they were booked for, if applicable) as a text file separated by line breaks.

####Online mode

Hit 'Finish' and you'll be taken to the finish screen where you can choose whether or not to mark and notify the absentees. 

If something went wrong during your attendance recording or you let in early arrivals then EventSwipe might have saved some of the attendance records offline. In this case you will get a prompt when you try to close EventSwipe indicating that there are unsaved records. Follow the offline mode saving instructions in this scenario.
