# EventSwipe
Current version: Buzzard

EventSwipe is a simple Java application for recording attendance at events.

It works by reading some kind of ID string (a student number, for example) and either checking this against a bookinglist or recording the ID in a text file to be processed later. The ID can be entered from a keyboard or any other external input device, like an RFID reader.
